# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The listener might not always trigger when a user's session is unexpectedly terminated, leading to potential authentication issues in your application.

The `authBug.js` file showcases a scenario where the application attempts to access user data based on the assumption of an authenticated state.  However, under specific network or server conditions, the `onAuthStateChanged` listener fails to update its state, creating a race condition.  This can result in unexpected behavior or crashes. 

The `authSolution.js` file provides a solution implementing more robust state management and error handling to reliably react to authentication changes.

This issue is not immediately obvious, especially for beginners. The improved code includes more checks and handles potential failures to ensure the application behaves correctly regardless of network or Firebase service status.
